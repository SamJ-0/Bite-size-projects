A clean and simple changelog component project based on a visual brief from:
[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-).

This project was built using HTML, CSS and Flexbox in order to practice layout, 
relative units(rem) and positioning.

This was focused on recreating the visual design so no Javascript was used.
